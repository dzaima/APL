/ - only reduce (/[] for first axis)
⌿ - only replicate
\ - only scan; executes left-to-right - aka isn't O(n^2)
⍀ - only expand
⍺⍺ & ⍵⍵ → ⍶ & ⍹
↑ - errors when ⍺>⍴⍵
↓ - errors when ⍺>⍴⍵
right operand of ⍣ takes arguments swapped (so most recent is ⍵)
dyadic f⌸ has ⍺ & ⍵ swapped (so A f⌸ B in Dyalog → B f⌸ A in dzaima/APL)

dfns:
  start line with ← to force returning (e.g. {1 ⋄ 2} returns 2, {←1 ⋄ 2} returns 1)
  this is useful with conditionals - {A:B ⋄ C} will execute B if A, but still execute and return C
  whereas {A:←B ⋄ C} returns B if A, leaving C then unevaluated.
  
⍺ of ⍴ can have a single ⍬ specifying that the number there should be fit to use all given items
"c" ←→ ,'c'
'abc' ←→ "abc"
"ab\ncd" ←→ 'ab',(⎕ucs 10),'cd'

monadic (A f) ←→ (A∘f); Can be continued into a longer train, i.e. (1+2×) ←→ {1+2×⍵}


A¨ ←→ {A}¨ (though A is evaluated only once)

ᐵ/ᑈ - each-left and each-right
⊥ & ⊤ default left arg = 2
⊤ with a scalar left arg is like Dyalogs ⊥⍣¯1

√ (2√ ←→ √), …, ⍥, ⍸, f⍤g, ⍢, ⍫, ⊇, ⍮, ⍛, ⍧ and ⍨ are implemented/updated as found in https://github.com/abrudz/dyalog-apl-extensions
⍸ works for input values outside of 0 & 1 (also ⍸⍣¯1 works)

⍡ & ⍁ have been added
monadic > & < sort
∨ & ∧ & ⍱ & ⍲ monadically are lcm(= some)/gcd(= all)/none/not-all of the array respectively (note that for the last two they're not just ⍲/ or ⍱/ !)
⌊, ⌈, ×, - for things with char cases

bigints:
  123L, ⎕BIG (most regular math functions work on them, even with regular numbers if there'd be no rounding; ⌊2⍟ is exact; √ floors)

⌽[dim] takes dim reversed

⎕-s:
  ⎕IO      : index origin; 0 or 1
  ⎕VI      : vector indexing. changes behavior if ⍳vec, ⊇, @, ⍸, etc.
  ⎕MILLIS  : time since starting
  ⎕STDIN N : read N lines of stdin (⍬ for until EOF)
  ⎕LNS 'f' : read lines of file f
  ⎕TIME    : time `⍎⍵` repeated ⍺ times (def = 1) in nanoseconds
  ⎕HTIME   : as above but convert to a human-readable format
  ⎕EX'path': execute the APL program in the file
  ⎕L/⎕LA   : lowercase alphabet
  ⎕ERASE'v': erase the variable v
  ⎕GC      : force Java garbage collection, return used memory in bytes
  ⎕NULL    : null object (value of undefined keys in maps)
  ⎕HASH arr: get hash of the array
  ⎕BIG arr : convert array to bigintegers (⍣¯1 to invert)
  ⎕NC 'v'  : array→2; function→3; dop→4; mop→5
  ⎕DR x    : https://github.com/dzaima/APL/blob/7fe18c1aa9b3bc36ffeff24e6cf7fd5a2745c2e5/src/APL/Scope.java#L736-L748
  ⎕GCLOG'v': log message upon getting garbage collected; Meant for testing for memory leaks (make sure to call ⎕GC before concluding anything!)
  ⎕MAP/⎕NS: hashmap with keys being strings (in the future there'll probably be another type with arbitrary keys)
    monadic: create from key-value pairs
    dyadic: left - keys; right - values
    get length: |map
    has items: ×map
    set:
      map.key ← value
      'key' (map⌸) value
    get:
      map.key
      'key'⊃map
      map⌸'key'



REPL:
  )ex filename
  )oneline: disable fancy boxes
  )quote: quote strings/chars
  
  )stack: stacktrace of last error
  )debug: debug info (useful for "couldn't join everything up into a single expression")
  )class: get java class of object
  )tokenize & )tokenizerepr: tokenize following text
  )off←→)exit←→)stop←→exit (yep, without a starting ")") all exit
